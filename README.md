# Data_Cleaning_PowerQuery
Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in datasets.
Clean and accurate data is essential for making informed decisions, conducting meaningful analyses, and ensuring the reliability of results. 

Some key reasons why data cleaning is important:

‣ Accurate Analysis


‣ Effective Decision-Making

‣ Data Integrity

‣ Preventing Bias

‣ Consistency Across Datasets

‣ Cost Efficiency

‣ Improved Data Quality

‣ Enhanced Data Privacy and Compliance

‣ User Trust and Confidence

‣ Streamlined Processes

‣ Facilitates Data Integration


In this project the dirty and messy datasets are cleaned using Power Query, which is a power and advanced feature of Microsoft Excel
Power Query, a feature available in Microsoft Excel and other Microsoft products like Power BI, is a powerful tool for data cleaning and transformation.
While Excel provides some basic data cleaning capabilities, Power Query offers several advantages that make it preferable for more advanced and efficient data cleaning tasks.

Various steps involved in the data cleaning process using Power Query in Microsoft Excel:


**1. Load Data into Power Query**

• Get Data:
         Open Excel, go to the "Data" tab, and click on "Get Data" to import data from various sources like Excel, CSV, database, or web.

• Transform Data:
     Load the data into the Power Query Editor by selecting "Transform Data" or "Load."

**2. Explore and Understand the Data**

 • Preview Data:
    Use the "Home" tab to preview and understand the structure of your data.

 • Data Profiling:
    Explore data profiling options to identify issues like missing values, data types, and distributions.

**3. Basic Data Cleaning**

  • Remove Duplicates:
    Remove duplicate rows using the "Remove Duplicates" option in the "Home" tab.

  • Filter Rows:
    Filter out irrelevant rows based on criteria using the filter options.

  • Handling Missing Values:
    Use the "Replace Values" option or filter out rows with missing values.

**4. Advanced Data Transformations**

   • Split Columns:
     Split a column into multiple columns using the "Split Column" option.

   • Merge Queries:
    Combine data from multiple queries or tables using the "Merge Queries" option.

   • Pivot and Unpivot:
    Reshape your data by pivoting or unpivoting columns using the respective options.

**5. Text and Data Formatting**

   • Change Data Types:
    Convert data types of columns using the "Change Type" option.

   • Text-to-Columns:
    Split text values into separate columns using the "Text-to-Columns" feature.

   • Trimming and Cleaning:
    Remove leading or trailing spaces, and clean up text using functions like Text.Trim and Text.Clean.

**6. Custom Transformations**

   • Create Custom Columns:
    Add new columns with custom calculations using the "Add Column" tab.

   • Apply Functions:
    Use built-in or custom functions to manipulate data within columns.

**7. Filter and Sort Data**

   • Filter Rows:
    Apply filters to include or exclude specific rows based on conditions.

   • Sort Data:
    Sort data based on one or more columns using the sorting options.

**8. Manage Queries**

   • Rename Queries:
    Rename queries for clarity and better organization.

   • Organize Queries:
    Arrange queries in a logical order for better management.

**9. Document Steps and Add Comments**

   • Comments:
    Use comments to document each step for clarity and future reference.

**10. Close and Apply Changes**

   • Close and Apply:
    Once satisfied with the transformations, close the Power Query Editor and apply the changes to load the cleaned data back into Excel.

**11. Refresh Data**

   • Refresh Data:
    If the source data changes, refresh the query to reflect the latest updates.

**12. Save Workbook**

   • Save Workbook:
    Save the Excel workbook with the cleaned data.
